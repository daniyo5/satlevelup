  const passageSpace = "I felt the wall of the tunnel shiver. The master alarm squealed through my earphones. Almost simultaneously, Jack yelled down to me that there was a warning light on. Fleeting but spectacular sights snapped into and out of view, the snow, the shower of debris, the moon, looming close and big, the dazzling sunshine for once unfiltered by layers of air. The last twelve hours before re-entry were particularly bone-chilling. During this period, I had to go up into the command module. Even after the fiery re-entry splashing down in 81-degree water in the south pacific, we could still see our frosty breath inside the command module.";
  const passageElephant = "But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his bunch of grass against his knees, with the preoccupied grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. I had never shot an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill a large animal.) Besides, there was the beast's owner to be considered. But I had got to act quickly. I turned to some experienced-looking Burmans who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephant had been behaving. They all said the same thing; he took no notice of you if you left him alone, but he might charge if you went too close to him.";
  const passageHarold = "Harold, a professional man who had worked in an office for many years, had a fearful dream. In it, he found himself in a land where small slug-like animals with slimy tentacles lived on people's bodies. The people tolerated the loathsome creatures because after many years they grew into elephants which then became the nation's system of transport... Harold suddenly realised that he himself was covered with these things, and he woke up screaming. In a vivid sequence of pictures this dream dramatised for Harold what he had never been able to put in to words; he saw himself as letting society feed on his body in his early years so that it would carry him when he retired. He later threw off the 'security bug' and took up freelance work.";
  const passageLaws = "Laws of nature are not commands but statements of acts. The use of the word 'law' in this context is rather unfortunate. It would be better to speak of uniformities in nature. This would do away with the elementary fallacy that a law implies a law giver. If a piece of matter does not obey a law of nature it is not punished. On the contrary, we say that the law has been incorrectly stated.";
  const passageLions = "Male lions are rather reticent about expending their energy in hunting... more than three quarters of kills are made by lionesses. The lionesses are in front, tensely scanning ahead, the cubs lag playfully behind and the males bring up the rear, walking slowly... But slothfulness may have survival value. With lionesses busy hunting, the males function as guard for the cubs, protecting them particularly from hyenas.";
  const passageNehru = "Nehru's was a many sided personality. He enjoyed reading and writing books as much as he enjoyed fighting political and social evils or residing tyranny. In him, the scientist and the humanist were held in perfect balance. While he kept looking at special problems from a scientific standpoint. He never forgot that we should nourish the total man. As a scientist, he refused to believe in a benevolent power interested in men's affairs. but, as a self proclaimed non-believer, he loved affirming his faith in life and the beauty of nature. Children he adored. Unlike Wordsworth, he did not see him trailing clouds of glory from the recent sojourn in heaven. He saw them as a blossoms of promise and renewal, the only hope for mankind.";
  const passageWork = "What needs to be set right is our approach to work. It is a common sight in our country of employees reporting for duty on time and at the same time doing little work. If an assessment is made of time they spent in gossiping, drinking tea, eating 'pan' and smoking cigarettes, it will be shocking to know that the time devoted to actual work is negligible... The administration set up remains week mainly because the employees do not have the right example to follow and they are more concerned about being in the good books of the bosses than doing work.";
  const passageSpeech = "A slip of the tongue, the use of unusual word, or of an ambiguous word, and so on, may create an enemy where we had hoped to win a friend. Again, different classes of people use different vocabularies, and the ordinary speech of an educated may strike an uneducated listener as pompous... Thus speech is not a gift to use lightly without thought, but one which demands careful handling. Only a fool will express himself alike to all kinds and conditions to men.";

What makes something (or someone) the 'same' thing over time if all its constituent parts change? This applies to humans as well: our cells are constantly replaced, our memories and beliefs change, yet we feel we are the same person. The paradox forces us to consider whether identity resides in the physical components or in something else, like a pattern, structure, or continuity of consciousness.",

        <p class='question-passage'>The 'anthropic principle' is the idea that our observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious life that observes it. Some use this to argue that the universe's physical constants (like the strength of gravity) are so finely tuned for life that it implies intelligent design. A counterargument, however, is the 'puddle analogy': a puddle of water waking up and thinking, 'This hole fits me perfectly! It must have been designed for me!' In reality, the water simply takes the shape of whatever hole it finds itself in.

The 'perfect fit' isn't evidence of design, but rather a selection bias: we only exist in the kind of universe that could produce us, just as the puddle only exists in a hole that can hold it.

A bright-line rule is a clear, objective standard that is easy to apply (e.g., 'You must be 18 to vote'). A balancing test is a more flexible, subjective approach where a court weighs various factors to make a decision (e.g., determining what constitutes 'fair use' in copyright law).

      explanation: "The denominator is $4^{1/3}$, which is the same as $(2^2)^{1/3}$ or $2^{2/3}$. To rationalize the denominator, we need to multiply it by a factor that makes the exponent an integer. Multiplying $2^{2/3}$ by $2^{1/3}$ gives $2^{2/3 + 1/3} = 2^1 = 2$.

      explanation: "In an arithmetic progression, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, $x - (x-2) = (x+3) - x$. This simplifies to $2 = 3$, which is a contradiction. The problem likely has a typo. A common variant is that the terms form a geometric sequence. If they form a geometric sequence, the ratio is constant: $\\frac{x}{x-2} = \\frac{x+3}{x}$. Cross multiplying gives $x^2 = (x-2)(x+3) = x^2+x-6$, so $0 = x-6$, and $x=6$. Let's assume the question meant $x-3, x, x+3$. Then $x-(x-3) = 3$ and $(x+3)-x=3$. This works for any $x$. Let's assume the question had a typo and meant $x-2, x+1, x+3$. Then $(x+1)-(x-2)=3$ and $(x+3)-(x+1)=2$. No. The question as stated is flawed, but a common interpretation leads to one of the answers. Let's assume the problem is correct and re-evaluate. The question is flawed.",

If $x = -0.6$, it's less than $-0.5$, but not less than $-1$. Let's test the boundary. If $x=-1$, $-1-3=-4$ and $3(-1)-2=-5$. $-4 > -5$, so $x=-1$ is a solution.

So we have $4a3+984=13b7$. The number $13b7$ is divisible by $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ says the alternating sum of digits must be divisible by $11$. $(7+3) - (b+1) = 0$ or a multiple of $11$. $10 - b - 1 = 9 - b$. For this to be divisible by $11$, $9-b=0$, so $b=9$. Now from the addition, $a+8=b$ or $a+8=10+b$. If $b=9$, then $a+8=9 \\Rightarrow a=1$. The sum $a+b = 1+9=10$.",

      explanation: "When rotated about the side of $3$ cm, that side becomes the height ($h=3$) of the cone. The side of $4$ cm becomes the radius of the base ($r=4$).

      explanation: "Let the cylinder's radius be $r$ and height be $h$. We are given $h=2r$. A cross-section through the center forms a rectangle inscribed in a great circle. The diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the sphere, $2R$. By Pythagorean theorem, $(2r)^2 + h^2 = (2R)^2$. Since $h=2r$, we have $(2r)^2 + (2r)^2 = 4R^2 \\Rightarrow 8r^2 = 4R^2 \\Rightarrow r^2 = \\frac{R^2}{2}$. The volume of the cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h = \\pi (\\frac{R^2}{2})(2r)$. We need $r$ in terms of $R$: $r = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}$. So, $V = \\pi (\\frac{R^2}{2})(2\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}) = \\frac{\\pi R^3}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This isn't an option. Let me re-read...
